#
# A semaphore gates access so threads block (instead of crashing with PoolError)
# when all connections are in use.

# Thread-local caching: `hold_connection()` pins one connection to the current
# thread so nested `_get_conn()` calls share the same transaction — lets
# `sync_workers_state` take `LOCK TABLE` once and have all subsequent
# `mark_worker_*` calls respect it on the same connection.
